    Yeah.

    So let's see where we can get better than this.

    We needed a project so this can build a standard template where all of us can stick to one common standard

    of defining test cases.

    Now.

    Does that the in the human genome project with the fate of six members.

    So each person will have his own style of defining discusses some uses of business terminology in writing

    it this is like make a credit card payment processing and some say click on submit button and then I

    want indexed to take then take box.

    He must be all the same.

    You ain't done that language again which might be or sometimes to go back and read that this is why

    so people have you know their own perspectives and I think that's OK.

    So there should be a common practice.

    Common complaint where all the.

    Q So stick to that and follow that particular procedure so you can use a really an approach best guess

    format could define this case.

    So tomorrow if someone Johnson to the project assume that I think is for the Ennius you have done six

    years of work and you are sort of functionally we have Bellah.

    It's like some hundred pages or better and the UK joined the team of the CCS and if you want to get

    to the application the best one is going to just guess if there should be brought up on a farm and a

    proper understanding of those so that you'll be able to follow the functionality.

    So if you can go on by adding a different format like each user have the data in his own style of writing

    test cases.

    So newbies are a new users cannot get sticking to that and cannot understand the format of it because

    he might try to get them based on his own convenience and may not understand it.

    OK.

    So the other game and he didn't so specific saying you know what they won't go on because most of them

    in one guy feels that OK I just do the business value and make the payment.

    And then that is the end of the radius.

    And that is you know becoming a major problem in these days especially Nazem products.

    So people will go and come you know it's cross-functional right.

    So you cannot say that this security will stick and I predict that spring is happening on every business

    .

    People may switch to other teams of this may step into development so there should be a proper template

    .

    So people should stick to that best guess.

    So in that Bumpass No people will go for BTD so that they can use a common reference to write their

    best guesses.

    And here when you write this in audio it's not your place of business man.

    Right.

    I agree.

    So if you go out and see that maybe you have written the scenario this scenario reflects a business

    value of correct government.

    So if you have hundreds of projects you can only say that there are 100 business values.

    We have developed and tested for our product gave you pay some hundred scenarios that means you also

    enhance their business value requirements.

    That is the most important one.

    Right.

    And next you can estimate the best coverage happen for either business done by goal or best Arias case

    it does.

    Yeah.

    So you're going to make the discoveries.

    Right.

    So this is my scenario where is that correct.

    And here you are defending any number of test cases to satisfy that scenario right.

    So now you can actually if someone ask you what's set test coverage for this credit card payments.

    And you can bring on all these kind of Vasquez's which you have written to support that the scenario

    that you are following improper and under the scenario we're simply defining the different kind of test

    cases.

    You can go ahead and watch these and you can estimate how much test is worth collates happen.

    For this single scenario.

    You don't have a single track what's happening in home it's testing you're doing that for that particular

    credit card payments.

    And one more interesting and excellent tool to have and one of the most reason why people are using

    BDD.

    You can actually drag this out additions to selenium web driver and you can take security on our commission

    test just by taking these as you were ask is OK if something has failed in the open you will see this

    as read by seeing output file of selenium automation.

    We can come to the conclusion that OK this was in the back room we consider OK this way.

    You need not have the board being you know how has damaged the parking lot and are just fine just fine

    .

    Complete fine with this gets us to your mission project and it will interbred and it will not complete

    execution if you write a proper coding you need to record.

    Just in our what with just passing this by.

    And finally we'll get a report in this with a fine with complete green background.

    If everything is passed if you feel that script failed here why not can get a message uncomplete greenback

    don't feel justified.

    You will see in this latest Greg just making them do it all within seconds.

    You can just find out that this is only system fail in my observations and some over that when we're

    talking when I talk about the lectures I can see that if you're part of my selenium or mission or happy

    I'm a a mission boss fight.

    So.

    And also Tharman stands as a template for both man and the mission testing because most of the projects

    that people will have their own best guess is in operation people will have their own this is because

    it cannot go hand in each and every man task is going to have some separate art.

    This gives us for you designed by man we've been arguing whether we should be able to reason our own

    selves but with this behavior.

    I misspoke just now.

    You can actually bank data on our patients and you can connect to our mission ISS so you can make a

    comment then play.

    Management Manimal people can use these.

    And even our mission team can use this Vasquez's legs and you know that our mission best suits but because

    we are actually tagging these missions to other mission annotations in selenium.

    OK I'm speaking of selenium.

    So there's a proper integration for you that's typical but you'll which provider indignation for us

    when it gets to selenium so that you can actually count on these.

    OK.

    So you need to break this case and into these just get it back.

    So I'm speaking directly about my other mission testing them or whatever.

    Do you understand what I speak about with your brain so that they can be calm and standardized and clear

    .

    The main reason people are proposing for abilities that they can integrate these foods or find them

    and they can see a problem with us and then at the same time you can stick to common Blair.

    So every man can have the common perception that inventing the old terminals is.

    That's a that's pretty much evil behavior driven approach in software project.

    OK thank you

    1. Really liked this course, very helpful for improving testing in React. Solid overview of RTL and the combination of the notebook app and the larger project with real testing examples worked well. I felt like it was missing some more advanced testing examples, like testing hooks, and some test env setup like coverage reporting, globals etc.
    2. Stephen consistently produces high-quality content every time. I have already passed three courses, and all of them were outstanding and easy to understand. Thank you for your efforts!
    3. Amazing explanations and easy to understand. I would recommend if you need an in depth basis of understanding for Jest and React Testing Library.
    4. Right off the bat, I would like to say that I already had several years of experience with jest. I took this course, mainly to fill the gaps that I am missing. I am really pleased with this course, it helped me on my thought process.
    5. I would omit the first part where you are using vs code in the cloud. Could never find that Test menu. Also, debugging unit tests? I skipped that part but I still watched the lectures. In all great course, would of been even better with TypeScript! But anyways, still, great course!
    7. Great course. It is obvious he cares about teaching. Thanks for all you hard work.
    8. Overall the course is great, however I think it's missing a section on how to test hooks and how to mock hooks in react componenets. Would also love a section on how to test function calls
    9. Initially it seems very simple, then as soon as the parts about data fetch are introduced it introduces many complex concepts with explanations that are in my opinion hurried, the course in the final part becomes very difficult to follow
    10. I love courses from stephen, but I've to say that in this case just using create react app built application and very low info on jest is a bummer. Expected more jest related content, there is not even a jest.config.js file as it will not work out of the box with cra apps which are dead now if you're working with new app. This needs a major upgrade, it could have been a 2hr beginner course tbh
    11. This is more about beginners. Also it only focuses on component testing.
    12. This course is exactly what I was looking for, a guide to ease me into testing in React, and explain the way of thinking that should be implemented when testing. The examples and code demos are also very helpful.
    13. Thanks for your course.That really great, save me more time to understand and work with testing library, also had comprehensive view about testing, thank you so much
    14. I could not always follow, but replayed the parts, especially at the end, over and over again, until I saw what you did there. Nice job, your teaching style really connects with my learning style, because you repeat important stuff over and over again, which I very much liked and hopefully never forget ;)
    15. Overall the course is good for beginner but I would like to see another module for react router testing
    16. This course is a wonderful job by Stephen. Thinking of making this course in the first place is so thoughtful of him. Stephen has a way of breaking down complex and intertwined concepts into absorbable pieces. Many times when he wanted to provide a 'complex' solution to a testing problem, he'd display a snapshot of what is to be done before he actually starts coding. Many times I wonder how I was able to easily understand certain difficult concepts. I think Stephen is also a psychologist, understanding how the human brain works. Kudos, Stephen!
    17. Still I am enjoying course contents and excellent explanation. Stephen is really a good teacher. My great thanks to him for his efforts on this course.
    18. I recently completed the "React Testing Library and Jest: The Complete Guide" course on Udemy, instructed by Stephen Grider, and I must say it was an exceptional learning experience. As someone with prior knowledge of testing, this course took my understanding to advanced levels. The instructor, Stephen Grider, did a remarkable job in presenting the material in a comprehensive and thorough manner. The course was incredibly complete, covering all essential aspects of React Testing Library and Jest. The way Grider breaks down complex concepts into digestible, practical lessons is commendable. The practical examples and hands-on exercises helped solidify my understanding of the testing principles and best practices. I appreciated the instructor's attention to detail and the clear explanations throughout the course. By the end of the course, I felt confident in my ability to write effective tests for my React applications. Grider's teaching style and the depth of content truly exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to master React testing and take their skills to the next level.Kudos to Stephen Grider for putting together such a valuable and comprehensive course!
    19. It just keeps getting better as I progress through the sections
    20. Really good walk through of basic tests. Thorough explanations of what gets returned based on the prefix used for testing (i.e., getBy..., queryBy..., findBy...). Glad to see bug report examples and seeing problems arise with 3rd party software.
